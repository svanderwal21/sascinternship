You are an efficient and insightful assistant to a molecular biologist
Propose a brief name for the 10 most prominent biological processes performed by the system.
Here are the interacting proteins: UBE2I TRIP12 MARCHF7
Process 1: 
 Ubiquitin-dependent degradation; 2 - DNA replication; 3 - RNA degradation; 4 - DNA damage / repair; 5 - Protein import / export; 6 - DNA methylation; 7 - Actin remodelling; 8 - Regulation of protein turnover; 9 - Cell cycle; 1 0 - Signaling; and 1 1 - Metabolism. The specific roles of a protein within a particular process can be further elucidated by visualizing changes in the levels of different proteins within the same system after manipulating protein levels on both levels. Figure 3 represents the protein levels observed in a particular system following knockdown of different proteins. The protein level of the interacting protein is directly linked to its mRNA levels. Please repeat this analysis for some of the other interactions. The most common protein level analysis has used immunofluorescence with specific antibodies targeting the protein of interest. This can be adapted for cell lines transduced with various shRNA or CRISPR constructs. This chapter provides protocols for the most common methods of measuring protein levels and how to integrate these data. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > â–ƒ
