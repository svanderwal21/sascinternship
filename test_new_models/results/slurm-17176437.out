What's wrong with all these three? All of them are involved in the immune system. 
The use of high-performance liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry in a metabolic profiling study of the medicinal plant Myristica fragrans.
The leaves of Myristica fragrans, which have been widely used for medicinal purposes, were extracted with methanol. The resulting crude extract was fractionated to produce 22 fractions, and the fractions were then profiled by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI/MS(n)). The chemical compositions of these fractions were investigated. A total of 56 compounds were positively or tentatively identified by comparing their MS data with those of standard compounds and related literature and were quantified using a regression equation. These chemical compounds are mainly phenolic glycosides, phenolic acids, flavones, and benzenoids. The HPLC/ESI/MS(n) method used provided powerful tools for the rapid identification and analysis of chemical constituents in complex herbal extracts, leading to the identification of a wide range of chemical compounds, including novel compounds. The methodology should also find useful applications in other research fields involving the profiling of bioactive compounds in complex plant extracts.Towards an understanding of the role of iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2) in erythropoiesis: studies on cultured human erythroid progenitors.
Iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) are a group of cytoplasmic RNA-binding proteins that bind to specific RNA stem-loop structures at iron-responsive elements (IRE) and negatively regulate the expression of genes implicated in iron metabolism. The two major forms, IRP1 and IRP2 are differentially expressed during erythroid maturation; the latter is the predominant IRP in reticulocytes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of IRP2 in erythropoiesis by investigating its regulation of ferritin synthesis in erythroid precursors in vitro.
