While, MUC2 is most highly expressed in the small intestine, MUC1 is expressed predominately in the intestine, ovary, and breast. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > They used NetMHCPan to predict the MHC class II epitopes contained within the MUC2 and MUC1 proteins. These peptides were then used to stimulate the CD4 + T cell clone T4 7D, which recognized an epitope located at the beginning of the MUC1 VNTR domain that is shared by MUC1. 1 and MUC1. 3. To begin their analysis, the authors used mass spectrometry to identify proteins that are associated with CD4 TCR-MUC1 complexes on T4 7D cells. After immunoprecipitating MUC1 and isolating co-precipitating proteins via mass spectrometry, the authors were able to identify several molecules previously shown to interact directly or indirectly with CD4, including CD3zeta, ZAP7 0, and the Lck tyrosine kinase. Following this, they used immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry to identify proteins that were constitutively associated with the MHC class II machinery such as HLA-DR, HLA-DP, and HLA-DQ. Furthermore, they identified several E3 ubiquitin ligases that were also constitutively associated with MUC1 / HLA-DR; these proteins were likely being ubiquitinated due to the association with an active ubiquitin ligase. Finally, the authors employed a peptide library approach coupled with MHC II immunoprecipitation to determine which amino acids were critical for binding to the MUC1 / HLA-DR. The authors used this as a filter to narrow down the list of candidates for further investigation. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > After these initial steps, the authors further narrowed

The core bioinformatics workflows

I like to have the 'Process' part as follows:

In this first block, describe whatever the protein in question performs
In the next step, put the text in brackets, e.g:

The binding step of MUC1 takes place during cleavage by a putative protease.
It is important to note that the cleavage product may not always be present.
The following process steps may appear in the final product:

The product is incubated with a protease at a substrate that is not present
The product and the substrate interact

You can, in some cases, omit the product step altogether. The final product may appear
in the form:

MUC1 binding at protease cleavage site

Or

MUC1 cleavage product

Again, the final product may not always be present and this information will need to be provided.

If you need to go further, then put the following code before the first 'while' clause:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

from Bio import Process, ProcessInfo

# This is the start of the process
Process = ProcessInfo(name = "HLA-DRB4 MUC21 MARCHF7 FANC")

The first 'while' clause is:

while True:

    # Generate process information
    process = Process.getProcessInfo('CHAIN_ENTITY', 'CHAIN_ENTITY')
    process.display()
    process.wait()

    # Add the output information
    print process.getOutputName() + " is processing " +

The next step in the 'while' is the 'if' statement. It determines if the next
condition is true or false, since we are dealing with a process.
The else statement is the 'if' statement itself.

if process is True and processInfo are

Here are the interacting proteins: MUC21 MARCHF7 HLA-DRB4

There is a binding site for this protein on the DNA; it contains a

Pfam Band and the interaction is also found with GABPB.

Processes in which the proteins are most prominent occur; you may have a specific hypothesis about how they help you understand the process

Here are more about your first suggestion, as a testable hypothesis. MUC21 binds to human chromosomes

The process by which MUC21 affects human chromosome biology is unknown. This binding site is

\[in addition to having\] an

existential binding site for another sequence motif in all the known target chromosomes. Is this the primary or secondary binding site, or is there no other

partner?

MUC21 protein has a signal sequence

This may be a signal sequence for secretion, rather than a signal sequence for any specific chromosome binding site, as

this signal sequence is found in many secreted proteins

You can also predict secondary structure and signal sequences that direct protein secretion

Using the signal sequence, you predict that MUC21 will be

secreted from the cell

This is an example of

what you can do with bioinformatic predictions and biological experiments to

find out what is

someone's hypothesis

 about

.

This process is also performed by

MARCHF7, another interacting protein

The biological process, by which MARCHF7 is involved in the function of the proteins, is unknown.

The human

GABPB transcription factor is predicted to bind to

the binding site identified,

to which

MUC21 binds
