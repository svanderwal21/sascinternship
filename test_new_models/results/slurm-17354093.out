Process 1:

This is the process of formation of human sperm from gonocytes.

Process 2:

This phase is characterized by the migration of gonocytes to their final locations in the basement membrane of seminiferous tubules near Sertoli cells.

Process 3:

This process marks the entry of gonocytes into meiosis.

Processes 1 and 2:

Googocytes are germ cells migrating away from the genital ridge to the basement membrane of the developing testis.

Process 3:

The entry of gonocytes into meiosis, the germ cells which initiate meiosis at approximately 10 weeks of gestation in humans, is marked by the migration away from the genital ridge to the basement membrane of developing seminiferous tubules near Sertoli cells. This stage of germ cell development is the beginning of the male germ line, a population of cells that will generate spermatozoa and other germ cells in the adult testis.

The germ cells, or gonocytes, originate from a unique stem cell called the genital ridge stem cell. These cells are highly enriched for OCT4 when compared to other stem cell types and they are not fully differentiated. Germ cells migrate from the genital ridge and make up less than one percent of fetal testis cells. These germ cells undergo mitosis shortly after sex determination, forming gonocytes.^[@ref1]^ Gonocytes transition into prospermatogonia shortly thereafter and these cells, called spermatogonia, undergo one additional meiotic division^[@ref2]^ to become spermatocytes ([Figure 1A](#fig001){ref-type="fig"}).

In the postnatal testis, spermatogonia initiate the process of spermatogenesis, producing haploid spermatids which mature further to produce sperm.^[@ref2]^ This process of spermatogenesis can be broken down into several steps. The first step is mitotic proliferation of spermatogonia (also known as gonocytes) and the production of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) as an alternative to the maintenance of the pluripotent nature of SSCs as they only self-renew throughout the course of their life cycles ([Figure 1B](#fig001){
