TIP12, a tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein, is involved in the regulation of the anaphase-promoting complex / cyclosome. MARCHF7, a membrane-associated RING-CH finger ubiquitin ligase, is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle. Process 2: DNA replication. TIP12, a DNA replication protein, is involved in the loading of the minichromosome maintenance complex onto chromatin. Process 3: RNA processing. MARCHF7, a RNA helicase, is involved in the regulation of RNA splicing. Process 4: Protein folding. TIP12, a molecular chaperone, is involved in the proper folding of newly synthesized proteins. Process 5: DNA repair. MARCHF7, a ubiquitin ligase, is involved in the repair of DNA damage. Process 6: Signal transduction. TIP12, a molecular chaperone, is involved in the proper folding of G protein-coupled receptors. Process 7: Transcription. TIP12, a molecular chaperone, is involved in the regulation of transcription.
