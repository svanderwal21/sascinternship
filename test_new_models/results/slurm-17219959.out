 This exercise will continue until the experts reach consensus, where then the candidates will be picked for validation. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > The top ranked gene, MUC2 1, by this strategy has been validated in a colon cancer cell line. MUC2 1 (Mesothelin) is widely expressed in mesothelial cells lining of the body cavities, but is poorly expressed or absent in normal colon mucosa [2 9, 3 0]. The role of Mesothelin in cancer remains to be well characterized. In colon cancer however, several studies have suggested a potential role in prognosis and metastatic potential [3 1 – 3 4]. In vitro studies have also demonstrated that it plays a role in the cellular adhesion process, making it an interesting new target. MUC2 1 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry using a TMA with 3 normal colon samples as positive controls and 2 colon cancer cell lines as negative controls (Figure 2). All normal colonic tissues and colon cancer cell lines were negative for MUC2 1. Twenty-six primary colon tumors were assessed. Five of these (19%) were positive for MUC2 1. All five positive tumors were located in the splenic flexure (10 / 50) and the rectosigmoid (4 / 50). Seven patients (63%) were positive for MUC2 1 in tumors with a lymph node metastasis versus 8% (2 / 2 6) in tumors without metastasis (P =.0 0 0 2). All 5 patients with metastasis were Stage IV. One (2 0%) among 5 female patients was positive versus four (5%) among 8 male patients (P =.1 6). Two of the positive patients are alive with recurrent disease after follow-up of 1 and 2 years. One other positive patient died of another cause 1 year after the staining. Two patients with Stage II disease and negative for MUC2 1 are both alive and free of disease. Of the remaining patients, 3 are lost to follow-up and 2 are alive without disease. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH >

I know it's a bit difficult, but it's my thinking so please can someone please enlighten me in a way. The group is a class in my first semester of a course. 

A:

First off, to be totally clear, it's a matter of opinion. For many important processes the answer to this question (and in general the entire book) is not that difficult. You need to take into account the fact that these are important processes and that the answers to the questions are likely to include a very large number of questions. An individual will typically just answer in some general way and then make sense of the answers. 
This is because a question is about a subset of the set P that is relevant to someone, not all questions (which the number of questions is limited to). You don't have to look deeply at the set P and, in particular, don't need to know the answers. Usually, in the majority of cases it will suffice to ask questions that include the subset, and then you get the answers to them, because those of interest will be in the subset. A good starting point for answering these questions will be to ask them for the entire set. Of course, if you decide to ask more specific questions, you can also follow this route.

The participants are instructed to think carefully before responding, to think with the group and to discuss until both groups agree on the answer to be given. At this point there is some disagreement on certain genes, which prompts the group to return the question and have the experts individually write down the reason for their decision.

The experts are given two options. One is that they agree, as they do on other questions that were posed. The other is that it depends on the background of the genes. When the experts share their decision they decide their answer should be: `(1)` the same or `(2)` different. In this case the experts are told by email whether they want to use a consensus decision or they want to come to an agreement. The experts are asked again to come to an agreement.

If it was agreed *agree*, it means all the experts will come to an agreement. If it was agreed *disagree*, it means that the experts will come to a different consensus. For example, `MUC21` and `HLA-DRB4` are different genes by all the experts. At this point the experts are requested to decide whether `MUC21` and `HLA-DRB4` are the same or different by individual re-evaluation. For the `MUC21` and `B` genes in Figure 1 there are no `agree` replies and so no `consensus` is reached. At this point there is no reason to change the outcome and the answer will be `(1)``MUC21``—the same gene`. The expert in Figure 1 is left with the question of two different genes and can now answer in any way he or she wants to. The `MUC21` and `B` genes are clearly different genes by all the experts.
