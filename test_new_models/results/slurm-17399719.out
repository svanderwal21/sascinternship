For each important point, describe your reasoning and supporting information. Here are the interacting proteins: MUC21, MARCHF7, HLA-DRB4 Process 1: The proteins MUC21 and MARCHF7 are involved in the regulation of the tight junction. They are both transmembrane proteins. They are both localized at the apical surface of the cell. They are involved in the regulation of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition. The tight junction is a cellular structure that seals the intercellular space between epithelial cells. It is a dynamic structure that is regulated by various factors. The tight junction is a selective barrier that controls the passage of molecules between the cells. It also plays a role in cell polarity.
