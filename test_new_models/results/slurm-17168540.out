### Human: MUC21 MARCHF7 HLA-DRB4
### Assistant: 

SignalP: cleavage site between amino acids 25 and 26, location on the N-terminal side and probability 0.766.

### Biological Process (GOSLIK):

Cleavage of secreted proteins

### Cellular Component (CELLO):

*Membrane fraction*.

### Molecular Function (MUMPRE):

Carbohydrate binding.

### Sequence Similarity (BLAST):

Human MUC21 is found to be closely related to the extracellular domain of murine sperm surface antigen Sp17.

### Alignment (CLUSTALW):

Yes, two cysteine residues are aligned.

### Prediction Of Transmembrane Region (TMAP):: (PositionScan, TMHMM):

Yes, transmembrane domains are predicted in these residues.

To the best of our knowledge, MUC21 has never been studied experimentally or its function was not determined.

The main difficulty with such a detailed knowledge is that MUC21 was first characterized through the analysis of its *N*-terminal part, and not because of its long extracellular domain. We propose our approach to handle this issue using the known information from UniProtKB, where the function and the structure of some domains are mentioned.

In brief, MUC21, like MUC2 and MUC5B,[@b36-ijn-9-3399],[@b37-ijn-9-3399] has a long mucin domain, a signal peptide, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. This domain organization is common for many mucin proteins. The amino acid sequence of the extracellular domain of MUC21 contains a cleavage site between the SEA domain and the second part of the tandem repeat. This is a unique feature of MUC21 compared with other mucins, which has not been observed before.

SEA domains are involved in protein--protein interactions and may mediate adhesive functions through binding of
