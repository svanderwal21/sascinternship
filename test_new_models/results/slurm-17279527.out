Recently, E3 ubiquitin ligases have emerged as additional targets for anticancer therapy (Huang and Dixit, 2 0 1 6). These E3 enzymes are responsible for substrate specificity in ubiquination. There are more than 6 0 0 E3 enzymes annotated in the human genome (Li et al., 2 0 0 8). The Cullin-RING ligases (CRLs) are multi-subunit RING finger ubiquitin ligase complexes that play important roles in a broad spectrum of biological processes by catalyzing monoubiquitination or multi-monoubiquitination of protein substrates. The best studied CRL is the SCF (SKP1-Cullin1-F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligase, in which Cullin1 (CUL1), a core scaffold protein, interacts with one of dozens of F-box proteins in the complex to form a receptor for substrate binding (Cardozo and Pagano, 2 0 0 4). CUL1 was identified as oncogene, being overexpressed in a variety of cancer types (Würtele et al., 2 0 1 3). The SCF SKP2 (S-phase kinase-associated protein 2, also called FBXW7), targets p2 7 and many other cell cycle regulatory proteins for proteasome degradation (Nakayama and Nakayama, 2 0 0 6). In contrast to the well-characterized SCF SKP2 that is a regulator of the G1-S transition, the regulation and function of the related SCF FBXW7β complex is poorly understood. FBXW7β targets CDT1 for its degradation to prevent re-initiation of DNA replication during S phase (Jin et al., 2 0 0 6). FBXW7β was shown to target multiple substrates including MYC, MCL1, NOTCH1, PLK1, and several transcription factors (Koepp et al., 2 0 0 1; Welcker et al.

Here are the interacting proteins: UBE2I TRIP12 MARCHF7
Process 1:
The RNA polymerase II (POLII) forms the DNA double helix and transcribes it downstream, while the ribosomal protein (RPL32) binds the 5 -UTR of the RNA transcript. A complex consisting of RPL32, POLII and POLI that binds the 3'UTR of the RNA transcript is synthesized, which is then transcribed and translated to produce the DNA double helix. This process is performed one nucleotide at a time for the RNA polymerase.
Process 2:
The ribosome binds to a 5'-sense transcript and forms a complex whose RNA sequence is complementary to the 5 sense genome, such that transcript mRNA is separated by the POLII complex.
Process 3:
The DNA helicase (AH) and helicase A head (HA) complexes each catalyse two rounds of translation termination in order to generate three copies of the RNA transcript.
Process 4:
The elongase (E) complex, which is composed of an RNA polymerase (RNAP), a 5 -end processing activator (AP3) and a 2 -end processing activator (AP4) complex, is used to elongate or cut the mRNA into multiple transcript segments by binding to the RNA transcript. One strand of a transcript is broken by the 3 -end processing enzyme (NER) and the RNAP, which then transcribes the remaining strand.
Process 5:
The initiation complex (IN), which has four subunits, binds to a 5 -ATP and catalyzes ATP synthesis by ribosomal translation.
Process 6:
The elongation factor (EF)II complex interacts with the ATP synthase (EPS) to elongate the mRNA. The translation product is then used for the next step.
Process 7:
The 5 -end processing enzyme (NER) binds to the RNA transcript and forms the 5 -UTR to generate the 3'UTR.
Process 8:
The 3 -end processing enzyme (NER) binds to a 5 -ATP and catalyzes ATP synthesis to provide translation initiation for subsequent RNA transcripts.
Process 9:
The 3 -end processing enzyme (NER) binds to a 5 -ATP and catalyzes ATP synthesis for protein synthesis.
Process 10: A transcription termination factor (TEF
