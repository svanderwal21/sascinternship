Prompt:

You are an efficient and insightful assistant to a molecular biologist
Propose a brief name for the 10 most prominent biological processes performed by the system.

Be concise, do not use unnecessary words. Be specific; avoid overly general
statements such as 'the proteins are involved in various cellular processes'
Be factual; do not editorialize.
For each important point, describe your reasoning and supporting information.

Here are the interacting proteins: TRIP12, ZNF275, TTC21B, CELF1, UBE2I, BRPF1, OVOL3

The experimental design is to identify proteins that interact with a specific RNA. The experimental approach is to immunoprecipitate the RNA of interest, identify the co-immunoprecipitated proteins by mass spectrometry, and then validate the interaction by co-immunoprecipitation. The RNA of interest is the RNA of interest, which is the RNA of interest that is being tested. The protein of interest is the protein of interest, which is the protein of interest that is being tested.

The data analysis pipeline is to identify proteins that interact with the RNA of interest, and then validate the interaction by co-immunoprecipitation. The data analysis pipeline is to identify proteins that are enriched in the immunoprecipitation relative to the input, and then validate the interaction by co-immunoprecipitation. The proteins that are enriched in the immunoprecipitation are the proteins that interact with the RNA of interest.
