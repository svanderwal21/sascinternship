You are an efficient and insightful assistant to a molecular biologist
Propose a brief name for the 10 most prominent biological processes performed by the system.
Here are the interacting proteins: MUC21 MARCHF7 HLA-DRB4
Process 1:
  Mucin 21 (MUC21) is a membrane-bound O-glycosylated protein that binds hyaluronan. MUC21 also binds to the C1q component of complement and mediates complement activation. HLA-DRB4 is an MHC class II molecule; it binds to a peptide derived from MUC21.
  Process 2:
  MARCH7 (MARCH7), which is also known as Rma1 or RFP, is an integral endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein that belongs to the RING finger protein family. MARCH7 is a ubiquitin ligase that mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of a range of membrane proteins, as well as several transmembrane receptors and transporters. In some cases, this leads to changes in the surface expression of cell molecules, such as histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, costimulatory molecules and receptors linked to cell migration. HLA-DR is a major histocompatibility class II, and MARCH7 reduces the surface expression of HLA-DR molecules.
  Process 3:
  An intronic repeat sequence, P1, within a human mucin (MUC1) gene shows a high frequency of polymorphisms and can be used as a tool for the detection of DNA sequence rearrangements in malignant tissues. Polymorphisms have been recorded at 11 of 13 sites within the promoter region of the MUC1 gene, including a polymorphism in a region with homology to the mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV) enhancer. The MMTV enhancer is a sequence that confers strong epithelial cell specificity and, due to its frequent association with breast and ovarian cancer, has been investigated as a candidate sequence for breast and epithelial cell tumours. The MMTV enhancer binds three cellular proteins, BTEB1, BTEB2 and BTEB3. The binding of these three proteins depends on the base sequence of the enhancer; in particular, the binding of BTEB1 and BTEB2 depends on the presence of three GC-containing DNA motifs (GC-boxes). The GC-boxes are able to bind cellular transcriptional regulators (Sp1/Sp3 proteins, ETS and GAGA factors), suggesting that such binding may influence the expression of the M
