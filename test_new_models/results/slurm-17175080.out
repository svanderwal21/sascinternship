Question
========

Your patient is a 16-year-old male, non-alcoholic, who presented to the pediatric emergency department with a 2-day history of a right knee injury after an injury during a basketball game during the previous weekend. The patient complained of swelling and pain of his right knee with limited motion. The patient and his parents described a sudden onset of severe pain in the knee followed by a blow to the knee. He experienced nausea, vomiting and was unable to bear weight on his right leg. On examination, the patient was irritable, and had severe right knee pain but no ecchymosis or skin rash, or any other gross abnormality was found on the right knee. The patient was in the supine position, and a tender, well-differentiated bulge was palpated on the antero-medial aspect of the right knee. The knee was slightly restricted in flexion and extension, and also had a palpable limp in the anter-lateral direction. The patient's vital signs were stable, with normal heart rate and normal blood pressure and pulse oximetry. Physical examination revealed tenderness on palpation over the medial aspect of the right knee.

Question
========

What radiologic investigations/treatments/procedures will the physician recommend to the patient based on his complaints and physical exam findings?

Answers:
========

Antero-Posterior (AP) and lateral radiographs are done in the emergency (**[Figure 1A and 1B](#F1){ref-type="fig"}**).
