For each important point, describe your reasoning and supporting information. Here are the interacting proteins: UBE2I, TIP12, MARCHF7 Process 1: Ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation. 2UBE2I, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, is responsible for the transfer of ubiquitin to target proteins. TIP12, a tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein, is involved in the regulation of the anaphase-promoting complex / cyclosome. MARCHF7, a membrane-associated RING-CH finger ubiquitin ligase, is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle. Process 2: DNA replication. TIP12, a DNA replication protein, is involved in the loading of the minichromosome maintenance complex onto chromatin. Process 3: RNA processing. MARCHF7, a RNA helicase, is involved in the regulation of RNA splicing. Process 4: Protein folding. TIP12, a molecular chaperone, is involved in the proper folding of newly synthesized proteins. Process 5: DNA repair. MARCHF7, a ubiquitin ligase, is involved in the repair of DNA damage. Process 6: Signal transduction. TIP12, a molecular chaperone, is involved in the proper folding of G protein-coupled receptors. Process 7: Transcription. TIP12, a molecular chaperone, is involved in the regulation of transcription. Process 8: Cell cycle. MARCHF7, a ubiquitin ligase, is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle. Process 9: Apoptosis. TIP12, a molecular chaperone, is involved in the regulation of apoptosis. Process 1 0: Cancer. TIP12, a molecular chaperone, is involved in the regulation of cancer. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃
