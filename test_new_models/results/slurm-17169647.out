1.1  The Significance of the Hypereosinophilic Syndrome^(1)^
===========================================================

The hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a rare condition characterized by persistent eosinophilia of more than 1500 cells/μL^(1,2)^ ([Figure 1](#f01){ref-type="fig"}) and clinical manifestations related to tissue damage^(1,2)^. In HES, eosinophilia does not result from the activation of the eosinophilopoietic pathway, and it is not related to allergic, parasitic, or neoplastic diseases.

Figure 1Peripheral blood smear of a representative patient with HES showing increased eosinophilic leukocyte number with signs of eosinophil degranulation.

The causes of eosinophilia are very diverse, including allergic diseases, infections, neoplasms, drugs (systemic corticosteroids, chemotherapy), and HES^(2,3)^. However, HES is diagnosed in more than 75% of the cases.^(3)^

The symptoms of HES appear when the number of eosinophils reaches a certain level in various organs or tissues.^(4)^ Eosinophil-mediated tissue damage can occur in any organ, leading to damage of the cardiovascular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal systems, among other organs^(5)^ ([Figure 2](#f02){ref-type="fig"}). Of note, HES patients are frequently asymptomatic.^(4)^ The most common complaint is the presence of unexplained eosinophilia in the blood, which should indicate the need for hematological screening for HES.^(6)^
