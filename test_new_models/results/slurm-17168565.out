Example:

Human: UBE2I TRIP12 MARCHF7
Assistant: UBE2I, TRIP12, and MARCHF7 are involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, specifically in ubiquitin ligase activity.
Real Question:

Human: MUC21 MARCHF7 HLA-DRB4
Assistant:

MARCHF7 is reported to be a transcriptional activator that participates in embryonic development and that interacts with the p53-related molecule p73. HLA-DRB4 is considered a minor histocompatibility antigen, which could function as a cancer or pathogen antigen recognized by CD4+ T cells.

Question:

Human: MARCHF7 MUC21 DRB4 (DR4)

Assistant:

Although MARCHF7, MUC21, and HLA-DRB4 have been reported to be possible therapeutic targets in lung cancer, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. The three genes are also believed to be candidates of new multiple sclerosis susceptibility genes.

Assistance:

The functional relationship between these genes is reported in the GeneCards website (<https://www.genecards.org/>), the DisGeNET database (<http://www.disgenet.org/web/DisGeNET/menu>), and in the PubMed database (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/>). Although MARCHF7, HLA-DRB4, and MUC21 have been reported as therapeutic targets in lung cancer, their functional relationship has not been investigated. As new experimental techniques are available, such as high-throughput sequencing and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene editing, the functional relationships between genes can be investigated more effectively than ever before.

Question:

Human: MARCHF7 HLA-DRB4 (DR4) MUC21 MUC5AC

Assistance:

The MUC5AC genes are reported to be useful as therapeutic targets for cancers.

Question:

Human: HLA-DRB4

Assistance:

HLA-DRB4 is related to multiple sclerosis and could be a potential therapeutic target for multiple sclerosis.

Question:

Human: MARCHF7 MUC21

Assistance:

MARCHF7, MUC21, and HLA
