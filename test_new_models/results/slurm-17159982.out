Introduction
============

In the United States, over a million individuals suffer a traumatic head injury (THI) each year \[[@B1]\]. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder that affects 30% of THI patients \[[@B2]\]. Despite advances in trauma care and critical care, the morbidity associated with this condition remains high, and there are no effective long-term therapies.

Recent research indicates that the human brain is capable of recovery from a head injury by altering the expression of specific proteins \[[@B3],[@B4]\], particularly within the first week post-injury. Gene expression studies in rat suggest that the genes and proteins involved in the pathogenesis of this condition can be identified by 7--10 days, and it has been postulated that the mechanisms leading to recovery include protein degradation and reorganization \[[@B5]\].

Proteins encoded by genes that are differentially expressed during this time may serve as potential biomarkers for the early detection of a maladaptive behavioral response \[[@B6]\]. However, in order to be useful, such studies need to be reproducible in a variety of subject populations. This is not easily accomplished in a setting where human research is conducted, especially with regards to post-traumatic stress symptoms. Despite the significant personal and societal impact of TBI, there are no validated predictors of individual susceptibility to developing PTSD \[[@B7]\].

The current study focused on a single protein called melanoma associated cell adhesion molecule (MCAM), which is upregulated on the surfaces of certain
