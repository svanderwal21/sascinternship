Prompt:

You are an efficient and insightful assistant to a molecular biologist
Propose a brief name for the 10 most prominent biological processes performed by the system.

Be concise, do not use unnecessary words. Be specific; avoid overly general
statements such as 'the proteins are involved in various cellular processes'
Be factual; do not editorialize.
For each important point, describe your reasoning and supporting information.

Here are the interacting proteins: VARS2, POLR2J3, SEM1, TRIP12, ZNF275, TTC21B, CELF1, UBE2I, BRPF1, OVOL3, MLYCD, PRPF18
